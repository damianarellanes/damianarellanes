var resumeDesc = 'I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Computer Science at Lancaster University (UK) where I am also a member of the <a href="https://dslab.lancs.ac.uk/">Distributed Systems Group</a>. Before this, I was a Research Associate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester, where I obtained a PhD in Computer Science. My research interests center around theoretical foundations of models of emergent computation (esp. self-organising software models).<br/><br/><b>I am currently accepting PhD proposals<b/> in the areas of: (i) Self-Organising Software Models, (ii) Theory of Emergent Computation, (iii) Program Synthesis and/or (iv) Foundational Semantics for Self-Composition/Self-Programming. If you are interested, please email me your CV, academic transcripts and a short research proposal (2-3 pages).';//<br/><p style="color:red">***We have PhD studentships available for UK/International students (covering fees and living expenses)***<p style="color:red">';

//var resumeDesc = 'I am a tenure-track Professor in Computer Science at Lancaster University, with a prime focus on autonomic models of computation for the Internet of Things (IoT). To date, I have developed an algebraic programming model for the compositional construction of service-oriented IoT systems. This model, known as DX-MAN, underlies the principles of a workflow variability theory which allows the autonomic evolution of software behaviour at run-time (under highly dynamic contexts). The current state of the model derived a startup business proposal that won the Nick Sanders Kickstarter Fund (Masood Enterprise Centre) and the second prize in the Next Big Thing competition (Manchester, UK). It also won the Best Paper Award at the International Conference on Internet of Things (ICIOT 2018) and was the runner-up for the Carole Goble Medal (The University of Manchester).'
