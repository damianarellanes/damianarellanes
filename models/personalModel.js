Arellanes (2020)</i></br></br><i>"Although a philosophical fact is often considered a figment of imagination, it could actually be a node in a tree of infinite possibilities. The path to reach that node is full of probabilistic conditions that make it difficult to converge on that point. Science provides directions to find accurate solutions that allow a global visualisation of the critical path of possibilities to reach that point. Howbeit, the synergy between science and philosophy may potentially provide directions to find solutions that best describe the real essence of Nature\'s behaviour. Thus, believing in scientific truth does not deny that philosophy is a just possibility among an infinite set of possibilities (perhaps beyond transfinite cardinalities)." D. Arellanes (2012)</i></br></br><i>"The basis of existence and evolution of human beings lies in science; however, the fundamental reason for such an existence and evolution lies in the arts. Human beings need these factors to continue navigating through those infinite waters that get lost in its own immensity, while we try to find the right path that takes us to what we have craved, to that Truth that we do have craved."
